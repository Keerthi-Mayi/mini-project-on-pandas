# Mini-Project: Data Analysis with Pandas
A mini-project showcasing the use of pandas for data analysis. It demonstrates data manipulation, aggregation, and filtering techniques in pandas.

## Project Overview
The dataset used contains sales information, including categories, cities, payment methods, discounts, and revenue. This project answers the following five questions:
1. **Total Revenue by City**: Calculate the total revenue generated by each city.
2. **Top-Selling Category**: Identify the product category with the highest sales and the largest revenue contribution.
3. **Sales Discrepancies**: Find products with frequent sales issues, such as high discounts or missing prices.
4. **Preferred Payment Method**: Determine the most preferred payment method among customers.
5. **City Bias for Payment Methods**: Check if certain cities have a preference for specific payment methods.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.

## Repository Structure
- `Sales_Data_Challenges.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `mini project on pandas.ipynb`: Python script containing all analysis code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
